# NASA Homepage Replication

This project is a replication of the NASA homepage, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Viewing the HTML Pages

You can use `http-server` to serve your HTML files within GitHub Codespaces.

1. **Open the Codespace**:
    - Start your Codespace from your GitHub repository.

2. **Install http-server** (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

3. **Start http-server**:
    - Navigate to your project directory:
      ```bash
      cd /workspaces/NASA_homepage_replication
      http-server
      ```
    - This will start the server and provide URLs like `http://127.0.0.1:8080` where your files are served.

4. **Open Your Browser**:
    - Copy the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) from the output of `http-server`.
    - Paste it into your browserâ€™s address bar to view your `index.html` file.
